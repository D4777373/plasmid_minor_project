| File                         | What it does                                                       |

## üß© How It Works

- **HTML (`structure_calculator.html`):**  
  Sets up the calculator‚Äôs structure using Bootstrap for a modern look. The display, buttons, and history area are all here.

- **CSS (`style_calculator.css`):**  
  Gives the calculator its unique dark look, styles the buttons, and creates the ripple animation when you click a button.

- **JavaScript (`performance_hub.js`):**  
  Dynamically creates all the calculator buttons, handles your input, performs calculations, manages memory, and updates the history. It also triggers the ripple effect for a fun, interactive feel.
